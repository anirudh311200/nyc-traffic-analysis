## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes NYC traffic collision data (2021–2023) using Excel to uncover patterns in crash volume, seasonality, dangerous time windows, and contributing risk factors.
The goal: provide data-driven insights that support smarter traffic-safety decisions.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 📅 Collisions Peak in Spring/Early Summer
May–June show the highest crash counts, with totals declining into the winter months.

### 🚗 Weekday Rush-Hour Danger
Collisions cluster heavily between **3–6 PM on weekdays**, especially **Fridays**, which show the most intense volume.

### ⚠️ Late-Night Weekend Risk
Weekend traffic shows unusual risk at **midnight hours (00:00)** — a sharp contrast from weekday patterns.

### ❗ High-Risk Driver Behavior
- **Driver Inattention/Distraction** causes the most collisions overall.
- **Failure to Yield Right-of-Way** produces the **highest share of injury/fatal collisions.**

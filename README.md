## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes NYC traffic collision data (2021–2023) using Excel to uncover patterns in crash volume, seasonality, dangerous time windows, and contributing risk factors.  
The goal: provide data-driven insights that support smarter traffic-safety decisions.

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 📅 Collisions Peak in Spring/Early Summer
May–June show the highest crash counts, with totals declining into the winter months.

### 🚗 Weekday Rush-Hour Danger
Collisions cluster heavily between **3–6 PM on weekdays**, especially **Fridays**, which show the most intense volume.

### ⚠️ Late-Night Weekend Risk
Weekend traffic shows unusual risk at **midnight hours (00:00)** — a sharp contrast from weekday patterns.

### ❗ High-Risk Driver Behavior
- **Driver Inattention/Distraction** causes the most collisions overall.
- **Failure to Yield Right-of-Way** produces the **highest share of injury/fatal collisions.**

## 🧩 Objective 1 – Monthly Seasonality
- **Method:** Pivot table by Month-Year  
- **Key takeaway:** Collisions peak in late spring and summer months  
- **Visual:**

## 🧩 Objective 2 – Heatmap
- **Dimensions:** Weekday × Hour  
- **Key pattern:** Weekday rush-hour collisions spike between 3–6 PM, Fridays are most dangerous

## 🚀 Next Steps
This was my **first hands-on analytics project in Excel**.  
Next, I’ll be building projects in:  
- **SQL:** data extraction, joins, aggregations  
- **Power BI:** interactive dashboards  
- **Tableau:** visual storytelling & analytics  

The goal: continue expanding my analytics skill set while building a portfolio of **practical, real-world projects**.
